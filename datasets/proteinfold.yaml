Name: ProteinFold Dataset
Description: Compilation of genetic and structure databases and model parameters required to run AlphaFold2, ColabFold and ESMFold through the nf-core/proteinfold pipeline. It includes files from popular biological data resources such as UniProt, PDB, MGnify, BFD and other expandable profile databases as well as parameters from pre-trained deep learning models specialized in predicting highly accurate protein structures from protein sequences.
